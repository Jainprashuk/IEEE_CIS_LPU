      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Web Development Landscape</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Web development encompasses various domains, including front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.
        Front-end developers focus on crafting visually appealing user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end developers
        work behind the scenes to manage data, handle user authentication, and implement server logic. Full-stack developers bridge
        both front-end and back-end aspects to create end-to-end web solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Furthermore, the web development ecosystem includes frameworks, libraries, and tools that streamline development processes.
        From version control systems that enable collaborative coding to browser developer tools that aid in debugging and optimizing,
        there's a vast array of resources to explore.
